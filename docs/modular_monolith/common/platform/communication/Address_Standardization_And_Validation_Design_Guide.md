🗺️ Address Standardization & Validation Design Guide
(Europe – Turkey – United Kingdom)
🎯 Purpose

This document defines the design principles and implementation standards for address management and validation across European countries, including Turkey and the United Kingdom.
It aims to ensure a consistent, verified, and user-friendly address experience within corporate environments.

🧭 1. Scope

The address validation and standardization framework applies to:

Company and user address management within the system,

Partner, supplier, and customer address records managed by corporate clients,

Back-office and frontend address entry workflows,

API-based address verification via Google Maps Platform.

The system is not intended for public, high-volume consumer usage; it is optimized for enterprise-grade accuracy and low data redundancy.

🧱 2. Core Principles
Principle	Description
Accuracy first	Every stored address must be verified and geocoded before persistence.
Postcode-first UX	Users start address input by entering the postcode, then select from suggested valid addresses.
Autocomplete mandatory	Manual free-text entry is restricted; only verified suggestions are allowed.
Standardized structure	All addresses are stored in normalized fields (street, city, postal code, country, latitude/longitude).
Regional focus	Validation is limited to European countries, Turkey, and the UK.
Country awareness	Each record must include ISO country code (GB, TR, DE, etc.) for consistent formatting.
🗺️ 3. Address Validation Flow

Input phase

User provides postcode or partial address.

System uses Google Places Autocomplete restricted to target regions (Europe, TR, UK).

User selects one of the suggested addresses.

Validation phase

The selected place ID is verified using Google Geocoding API or Address Validation API.

The backend extracts structured components:
street, neighborhood, city, postal_code, country_code, and coordinates.

The address is normalized to the system’s canonical format.

If validation fails or country mismatch occurs, user confirmation is required.

Persistence phase

The verified and normalized address is stored in the database.

Raw user input (if any) is never persisted without validation.

Each address record retains geolocation coordinates for map-based services.

🇬🇧 4. Regional Characteristics
Region	Validation Quality	Recommended Behavior
United Kingdom	✅ Excellent	Use postcode-based lookup (Royal Mail or Google). Display full address after selection.
Turkey	✅ Good (major cities)	Use Google Autocomplete. Verify with postal code and city consistency check.
Western Europe	✅ Excellent	Geocoding highly accurate; follow postcode-first pattern.
Eastern Europe	⚠️ Mixed	Allow user confirmation if validation fails.
Non-EU fallback	⚠️ Partial	Store only validated city and country; request additional confirmation.
🔒 5. API & Security Configuration

Use Google Cloud Platform (GCP) APIs:

Places API, Geocoding API, and optionally Address Validation API.

Restrict API key to Europe and Turkey via region bias.

Apply domain or IP restrictions to prevent unauthorized use.

Store API key securely (environment variable).

Monitor request quotas to avoid unnecessary billing.

🧩 6. Data Model Alignment

Each verified address record should include the following normalized attributes:

Field	Description
street_name	Primary street line (auto-filled from API)
city	Normalized city name
district / county	Sub-administrative area
postal_code	Verified postal or ZIP code
country_code	ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code
latitude, longitude	Geolocation coordinates
formatted_address	Human-readable representation for UI
is_primary	Boolean flag for default selection
💡 7. User Experience Standards

Autocomplete only: prevent free-text input errors (“Ankora”, “Londan”).

Instant feedback: show validation result (✅ Verified / ⚠️ Not Found).

Postcode lookup: especially in the UK, list all addresses under a single postcode.

Address review: allow users to confirm or correct the validated data before saving.

Multilingual support: display in local language and Latin transliteration (for TR and EU).

Consistency: all addresses follow the same UI and format regardless of country.

🧾 8. Benefits

Unified, verified address data model.

Minimal user typing and zero spelling errors.

Seamless integration with Google Maps features (distance, routing, geofencing).

Corporate-level consistency across user, company, and partner addresses.

Easier auditing, filtering, and reporting on geographic data.

🚀 9. Summary

This design ensures:

A European-grade standardization of address data,

Error-free input via autocomplete and postcode lookup,

High accuracy through backend validation and normalization,

Scalable yet controlled API usage suitable for enterprise systems.

✅ Result:
A unified, intelligent address management experience —
delivering reliability, precision, and professionalism consistent with European standards.
