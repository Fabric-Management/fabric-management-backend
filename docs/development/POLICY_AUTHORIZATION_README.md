## 🏗️ Architecture At-a-Glance

### Current State

```
✅ JWT Authentication
✅ Basic RBAC (role checks)
✅ Multi-tenancy (tenantId)
❌ Fine-grained authorization
❌ Company type differentiation
❌ Department-based routing
❌ User-specific grants
```

### Target State

```
✅ Policy-Based Authorization (PEP/PDP)
✅ Company Type System (INTERNAL/CUSTOMER/SUPPLIER)
✅ Department-Aware System
✅ User Grants (Advanced Settings)
✅ Data Scope (SELF/COMPANY/CROSS/GLOBAL)
✅ Audit Trail (Immutable, explainable)
```

### Request Flow

```
User → Gateway (PEP) → Policy Engine (PDP) → Service (Validation) → Audit (Async)
         ↓                    ↓                      ↓                    ↓
    JWT Check         Decision Logic         Scope Check        Kafka Event
```

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### 1. **PEP (Policy Enforcement Point)**

- **Location:** API Gateway
- **Role:** Traffic cop (enforces decisions)
- **Actions:** JWT validation, PDP call, header injection

### 2. **PDP (Policy Decision Point)**

- **Location:** Shared module (shared-infrastructure/policy)
- **Role:** Judge (makes authorization decisions)
- **Logic:** Company Type + RBAC + User Grants + Scope

### 3. **Company Type Guardrail**

- **INTERNAL:** Full access (read, write, delete)
- **CUSTOMER:** Read-only (limited scope)
- **SUPPLIER:** Limited write (purchase orders)
- **SUBCONTRACTOR:** Limited write (production orders)

### 4. **Data Scope**

- **SELF:** Own data only
- **COMPANY:** Company-wide data
- **CROSS_COMPANY:** Multi-company (special permission)
- **GLOBAL:** System-wide (Super Admin)

### 5. **User Grants**

- Endpoint-specific permissions
- Can ALLOW or DENY (DENY wins)
- Time-bound (TTL)
- Managed via Advanced Settings
