## 📋 PROBLEM SUMMARY

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/public/onboarding/register`  
**Symptom:** 503 Service Unavailable with "User Service is temporarily unavailable"  
**Impact:** Complete failure of tenant onboarding flow - new tenants cannot register

### Error Response

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "User Service is temporarily unavailable. Please try again later.",
  "errorCode": "SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-13T09:51:44.105309274"
}
```

## 🔍 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### Investigation Timeline

```
1. Initial Hypothesis: JWT authentication issue ❌
2. Second Hypothesis: Internal API Key missing ❌
3. Deep Analysis: Found TWO separate issues ✅
```

### The Two Issues Discovered

#### Issue #1: Missing Internal Endpoint Configuration

**File:** `shared-security/.../InternalAuthenticationFilter.java`

**Problem:**

- User Service calls Contact Service's `/send-verification` endpoint during onboarding
- This endpoint was NOT registered as an internal endpoint
- InternalAuthenticationFilter skipped it → JWT filter activated
- No JWT available during registration → 401 Unauthorized

**Evidence from Logs:**

```
fabric-contact-service | ERROR c.f.s.s.e.JwtAuthenticationEntryPoint -
  Unauthorized access attempt to:
  /api/v1/contacts/e2df00cb-5e41-45fa-bc84-bb3ecab8ae17/send-verification -
  Full authentication is required to access this resource
```

#### Issue #2: API Gateway Timeout Configuration

**File:** `services/api-gateway/src/main/resources/application.yml`

**Problem:**

- Tenant onboarding takes ~7 seconds (create company + user + contact + send verification)
- API Gateway timeout was set to 5 seconds
- Circuit breaker triggered before operation completed
- User received 503 error even though backend succeeded

**Evidence from Logs:**

```
API Gateway:
  09:51:38 - Request received
  09:51:44 - Circuit breaker triggered (duration=5231ms)

User Service:
  09:51:39 - Onboarding started
  09:51:46 - Onboarding completed successfully (7 seconds)
```

**Why It Took 7 Seconds:**

```
1. Company Service: Create company      → 2.8 seconds
2. User Service: Create tenant admin    → 0.1 seconds
3. Contact Service: Create email        → 1.7 seconds
4. Contact Service: Send verification   → 0.1 seconds
5. Database transactions & Kafka events → 2.3 seconds
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TOTAL:                                    7.0 seconds

API Gateway Timeout:                      5.0 seconds ❌
```

## ✅ SOLUTION APPLIED

### Fix #1: Register Internal Endpoint

**File:** `shared/shared-security/src/main/java/com/fabricmanagement/shared/security/filter/InternalAuthenticationFilter.java`

**Change:**

```java
private boolean isInternalEndpoint(String path, String method) {
    for (String endpoint : INTERNAL_ENDPOINTS) {
        if (path.startsWith(endpoint)) {
            // ... existing checks ...

            // ✅ NEW: Register send-verification as internal
            if (path.matches("/api/v1/contacts/[a-f0-9\\-]+/send-verification")
                && "POST".equals(method)) {
                return true; // Send verification (internal - tenant onboarding)
            }

            // ... rest of checks ...
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

**Why This Works:**

- Internal API Key authentication applied before JWT filter
- SecurityContext set with `INTERNAL_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL`
- Controller's `hasAccess()` method allows internal service calls
- No JWT needed for service-to-service communication

### Fix #2: Increase API Gateway Timeouts

**File:** `services/api-gateway/src/main/resources/application.yml`

**Changes:**

```yaml
resilience4j:
  circuitbreaker:
    configs:
      default:
        slow-call-duration-threshold: 8s # Changed from 2s

  timelimiter:
    configs:
      default:
        timeout-duration: 15s # Changed from 5s
    instances:
      userServiceCircuitBreaker:
        base-config: default
        timeout-duration: 15s # Explicit override for user service
```

**Rationale:**

- Tenant onboarding is a complex operation (4 service calls + DB + Kafka)
- 7 seconds is reasonable for this one-time operation
- 15 seconds provides buffer for network latency
- Circuit breaker threshold updated to avoid premature triggers

## 🧪 VERIFICATION

### Before Fix

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/public/onboarding/register

## 🎯 KEY LEARNINGS

### 1. Systematic Debugging Approach

**What Worked:**

```
1. Analyze logs from ALL services (not just the failing one)
2. Check timing/duration in logs (revealed timeout issue)
3. Trace the COMPLETE request flow
4. Verify internal authentication configuration
5. Check circuit breaker and timeout settings
```

**What Was Misleading:**

- Error message said "User Service unavailable" but user service was actually working
- The issue was in the infrastructure layer (timeout + auth filter), not business logic

### 2. Internal Service Authentication Pattern

**Critical Understanding:**

- Internal endpoints MUST be explicitly registered in `InternalAuthenticationFilter`
- Pattern matching must be precise (UUID regex: `[a-f0-9\\-]+`)
- Filter order matters: `@Order(0)` ensures it runs before JWT filter
- SecurityContext with `INTERNAL_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL` allows `hasAccess()` checks to pass

**Common Pitfall:**

```java
// ❌ WRONG: Too broad
if (path.startsWith("/api/v1/contacts")) {
    return true;  // Makes ALL contact endpoints internal!
}

// ✅ CORRECT: Specific pattern matching
if (path.matches("/api/v1/contacts/[a-f0-9\\-]+/send-verification")
    && "POST".equals(method)) {
    return true;  // Only this specific endpoint
}
```

### 3. Circuit Breaker Configuration

**Best Practice:**

- Set timeout based on actual operation duration + buffer
- Complex operations (multi-service) need longer timeouts
- Monitor slow-call-duration-threshold to avoid false positives
- Use different timeout configs for different operation types

**Configuration Strategy:**

```yaml
# Fast operations (single DB query)
timeout-duration: 3s

# Medium operations (single service call + DB)
timeout-duration: 5s

# Complex operations (multi-service choreography)
timeout-duration: 15s  # Tenant onboarding

# Batch operations (large datasets)
timeout-duration: 30s
```

### 4. Docker Build Cache

**Lesson Learned:**

- Configuration changes may not reflect if Docker uses cached layers
- Always use `--no-cache` when debugging configuration issues
- Verify changes are in container: `docker exec <container> cat /path/to/config`

## 🛠️ DEBUGGING CHECKLIST FOR SIMILAR ISSUES

When you see "Service Unavailable" errors:

- [ ] Check ALL service logs, not just the reported failing service
- [ ] Look for timing/duration in logs (timeout clues)
- [ ] Verify internal authentication filter configuration
- [ ] Check circuit breaker timeout settings
- [ ] Trace complete request flow (Gateway → Service A → Service B)
- [ ] Verify environment variables are loaded (INTERNAL_API_KEY)
- [ ] Check if Docker cache prevented new config from loading
- [ ] Test direct service-to-service call (bypass gateway)
- [ ] Enable DEBUG logging for filters and circuit breakers

## 🔮 PREVENTION STRATEGIES

### For Future Development

1. **Timeout Configuration:**

   - Always benchmark actual operation duration
   - Add 50-100% buffer for production (network latency, load)
   - Use environment variables for easy tuning: `${ONBOARDING_TIMEOUT:15s}`

2. **Internal Endpoint Registry:**

   - Maintain a checklist of all service-to-service calls
   - Document which endpoints are internal vs external
   - Add tests for internal authentication paths

3. **Monitoring:**

   - Alert on circuit breaker state changes
   - Track P95/P99 response times for complex operations
   - Monitor slow-call rates

4. **Testing:**
   - Integration tests for multi-service flows
   - Load tests for timeout tuning
   - Chaos engineering for circuit breaker behavior

## 🎓 TECHNICAL DEEP DIVE

### Why Two Fixes Were Needed

**The Relationship:**

```
User Service → Contact Service /send-verification
    ↓
Issue #1: 401 Unauthorized (Missing internal auth config)
    ↓
User Service → Feign throws exception
    ↓
Exception caught in TenantOnboardingService (line 165)
    ↓
Registration continues but takes longer
    ↓
Issue #2: API Gateway times out (5s < 7s operation)
    ↓
Circuit breaker triggers → 503 to client
```

**Even After Fix #1:**

- Internal auth would work
- But 7-second operation would still timeout at 5 seconds
- Circuit breaker would still trigger

**Even After Fix #2:**

- Timeout would be sufficient
- But 401 error would still occur
- Error handling would add latency

**Both Fixes Required:** Yes, to fully resolve the issue!
