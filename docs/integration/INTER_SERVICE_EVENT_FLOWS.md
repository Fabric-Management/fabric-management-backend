# Inter-Service Event Flow Diagrams

## 📋 Overview

This document provides comprehensive event flow diagrams showing how different services communicate through events in the Fabric Management System. These diagrams illustrate the asynchronous communication patterns and event-driven architecture.

## 🏗️ Event Architecture Overview

### **Event Types**

- **Domain Events**: Business logic events (UserCreated, OrderPlaced, etc.)
- **Integration Events**: Service-to-service communication events
- **System Events**: Infrastructure events (HealthCheck, ServiceDown, etc.)

### **Event Flow Patterns**

- **Request-Response**: Synchronous communication via REST APIs
- **Event-Driven**: Asynchronous communication via message queues
- **Saga Pattern**: Distributed transaction coordination
- **CQRS**: Command Query Responsibility Segregation

2. **Fan-In Pattern**: Multiple events aggregate into one service
3. **Saga Pattern**: Long-running transactions across services
4. **Event Sourcing**: State changes stored as events
5. **CQRS**: Separate read and write models

### **Message Queue Topics**

| Topic               | Purpose                 | Services                                     |

## 🚀 Implementation Guidelines

### **Event Design Principles**

1. **Immutable Events**: Events should not be modified after creation
2. **Versioned Events**: Support event schema evolution
3. **Idempotent Handlers**: Handle duplicate events gracefully
4. **Event Ordering**: Maintain event order where necessary
5. **Dead Letter Queues**: Handle failed event processing

### **Event Naming Conventions**

- **Past Tense**: Events represent completed actions
- **Descriptive**: Clear and unambiguous names
- **Consistent**: Follow established patterns
- **Versioned**: Include version information

### **Event Schema Standards**

```json
{
  "eventId": "uuid",
  "eventType": "UserCreated",
  "eventVersion": "1.0",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "source": "identity-service",
  "data": {
    "userId": "uuid",
    "username": "string",
    "email": "string",
    "tenantId": "uuid"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "correlationId": "uuid",
    "causationId": "uuid"
  }
}
```
