# Duplicate BaseEntity File Removed

This file previously contained a duplicate BaseEntity class with invalid Markdown syntax that was causing compilation errors including:
- illegal character: '#'
- illegal character: '`'
- duplicate class issues

The duplicate has been completely removed. The correct BaseEntity class is located at:
`/infrastructure/persistence/BaseEntity.java`
